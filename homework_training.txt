Hello world! This is a sample text for training BPE tokenizer.
BPE stands for Byte-Pair Encoding, which is a simple data compression technique.
It's widely used in natural language processing for tokenization.
The algorithm works by iteratively merging the most frequent pairs of bytes.
This creates a vocabulary that represents common byte sequences in the training data.
Tokenization using BPE helps reduce vocabulary size while maintaining effectiveness.
Machine learning models often benefit from BPE tokenization for handling text efficiently.
